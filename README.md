# One Dark Pro (Colorblind)

A colorblind friendly version of the popular One Dark Pro theme based on [binaryify's](https://github.com/Binaryify/) awesome project. For more information about the theme, please check the [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro.git) repository.

This theme includes 5 variations to choose for your liking. The differences between the variants are just the bracket and string colors.

### Note
All 5 variants are targetted only to users who have Deuteranopia (Red-Green colorblindness). Testing of readability was done on Python and JSON syntax.
